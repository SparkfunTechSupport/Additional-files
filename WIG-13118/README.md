By default, the Servo Trigger can only move 90 degrees. This is to protect your servo from attempting to move past the servos end stops. (which would damage the servo) You can program the Servo Trigger with alternate firmware that enables 180 degree rotation but you must be very careful to not set the A and B potentiometers past the servos physical limits.

The ServoTrigger180.hex file enables 180 degree rotation.
The servoTrigger90.hex file is the default firmware.
